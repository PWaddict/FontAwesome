# Font Awesome Module for ProcessWire 3.x

Upgrade ProcessWire's backend with the latest Font Awesome free icons (solid + brands).

## Install

1. Copy all files included in this module into new directory `/site/modules/FontAwesome/`.
2. In the ProcessWire admin, go to Modules > Refresh.
3. Click install for the Font Awesome module.
4. **IMPORTANT:** The module has a duplicated folder of the core's InputfieldIcon module where only 2 files (icons.inc, InputfieldIcon.js) have been modified so you must select the InputfieldIcon version from Font Awesome module to load. To do that go to InputfieldIcon module screen by using search or refreshing modules (you will get the duplicated notification) and on the section "Module file to use" select the proper version and click on Submit button.
